# Ground Zero — Additions / Updates to Idea Submission

Reference: [IDEA_SUBMISSION.md](IDEA_SUBMISSION.md) (MediVault GenAI Idea Submission)

This document lists points to add or update in the idea submission. Use it as a checklist when revising the main submission.

## Problem Statement

**Add:**

- **Insurance details of person, if any.**  
  Include in the problem statement: patients and caregivers often lack a single, clear view of **insurance information** (policy details, coverage, claims, pre-auth status) alongside their clinical records. When this is missing or scattered, it affects care decisions, billing, and continuity across providers.  
  *Suggestion:* Add a sentence or bullet under “Problem Statement” that explicitly calls out insurance details as part of the fragmented health picture (e.g. “Insurance details—policy, coverage, and claims—when present, are similarly scattered and not integrated with the rest of the health narrative.”).

---

## Optional: Other sections to extend (if desired)

- **Application:** Consider adding “insurance documents and policy summaries” to the list of document types users can upload, and example queries like “What is my current coverage for lab tests?” or “Summarize my insurance details.”
- **Proposed Method / Data:** If insurance is in scope, mention ingestion of insurance cards, EOBs, or policy PDFs in document ingestion and data sources.
